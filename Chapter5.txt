Review

    1. Name for major types of errors and briefly define each one. - 
    compile-time error: an error found by the compiler; link-time errors: an 
    error found by the linker; run-time error: errors found by checks in a
    running program; logic errors: an error created by misuse of logic by a 
    programmer

    2. What kinds of errors can we ignore in student programs? - logical errors

    3. What guarantees should every completed project offer? - the code will
    compile and run

    4. List three approaches we can take to eliminate errors in programs and 
    produce acceptable software. - organize software to minimize errors, 
    eliminate most of the errors we made through debugging and testing, make 
    sure the remaining errors are not serious

    5. Why do we hate debugging? - it can take a lot of time and difficulty to 
    figure out the problem

    6. What is a syntax error? - won't compile because syntax is incorrect or
    missing

    7. What is a type error? - a type that is assigned or initialized with a 
    different type

    8. What is a linker error? - when the linker cannot find an object or std_lib_facilities

    9. What is a logic error? - an error that a programmer makes in the code 
    that cannot be inferred by the compiler

    10. List four potential source of program errors discussed in the text. -
