    helps us run a lot of different types of equipment in general, which is 
    important in our current civilization.

    6. What are some jobs related to software development? Programmer, tester,
    software engineer, product manager/owner, electrical engineer, etc.

    7. What's the difference between computer science and programming? Computer
    science is understanding the science behind how programming works. Computer
    programming is just writing the code to make the idea work.

    8. Where in the design, construction, and use of a ship is software used?
    It is used from the beginning to the end. It is used to help design and 
    build the ship. It is used to run the ship and keep things going, so humans
    can get a break.

    ideas and requirements and transform them into code that produces a program
    that is useable.

    16. What are the stages of software development? Analysis, Design,
    Programming, Testing.

    17. Why can software development be difficult? It is often hard to make a 
    computer do exactly what you want to do. You have to figure out how to make
    a simple machine do something difficult.

    18. What are some uses of software that makes your life easier? Smart home

Exercises

    1. Pick an activity you do most days (such as going to class, eating dinner,
    or watching television). Make a list of ways computers are directly or 
    indirectly involved. - TV: there is a computer in the tv, my phone has 
    computers and that is what I use to stream, my router (internet) has 
    computers, as well as all the computers that it connects to, not to mention
    the computers used to make all the material that I watch.

    2. Pick a profession, preferably one that you have some interest in or some 
    knowledge of. Make a list of activities done by people in that profession 
    that involve computers. - I'm an embedded software engineer so there are 
    many computers involved.

    3. SKIP - now relevant

    4. From your own experience, describe an activity that would not have been 
    possible without computers. - Playing a video game is impossible without a
    computer. It takes a computer to write the game in the first place.

    5. SKIP - list is too large to write here.

    6. Make a list of ten activities that people do that do not involve 
    computers in any way, even indirectly. This may be harder than you think!
    - I can probably think of a way to tie a computer to any activity that 
    anyone else would come up with.

    7. Identify five tasks for which computers are not used today, but for
    which you think they will be used at some time in the future. Write a 
    few sentences to elaborate on each one that you choose. - cooking,
