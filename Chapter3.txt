Review                                                                         

    1. What is meant by prompt? - This is where characters can be input into the
    console.

    2. Which operator do you use to read into a variable? - =.

    3. If you want the user to input an integer value into your program for a 
    variable named number, what are two lines of code you could write to ask the 
    user to do it and to input the value into your program? 
    - cout << "What is the integer value? ";
    - cin >> number;

    4. What is \n called and what purpose does it serve? - It is a newline and 
    it prints the text after it on a new line in the console.

    5. What terminates input into a string? - Whitespace.

    6. What terminates input into an integer? - Any non-numeric character

    7. How would you write  
        cout << "Hello, ";
        cout << first_name;
        cout << "!\n";
    
    as a single line of code? - 
        cout << "Hello, " << first_name << "!\n";

    8. What is an object? - Some memory that holds a value of a given type.

    9. What is a literal? - A constant value that is assigned to a constant 
    variable.

    10. What kinds of literals are there? - Integer, float, character, string,
    boolean.

    11. What is a variable? - A named object.

    12. What are typical sizes for a char, an int, and a double? - Char: 1 byte,
    int: 2 or 4 bytes, double: 8 bytes.

    13. What measures do we use for the size of small entities in memory, such 
    as ints and strings? - bits

    14. What is the difference between = and ==? - = is the assignment operator,
    where == is a comparison operator (is equal to).

    15. What is a definition? - A statement that defines a variable and can 
    assign a value to a variable.

    16. What is an initialization and how does it differ from an assignment? - 
    An initialization is when the variable is created, the assignment is when it
    is given a value.

    17. What is string concatenation and how do you make it work in C++? - It is 
    the combination of two strings and it is done with the + operator.

    18. Which of the following are legal names in C++? If a name is not legal, 
    why not? - This_little_pig: technically legal, typically reserved for a type 
    name; This_1_is fine: not legal, has a space and starts with a capital; 
    2_For_1_special: not legal, starts with a number; latest thing: not legal,
    has a space; the_$12_method: not legal, has a special character; 
    _this_is_ok: technically legal, but reserved for system names, don't write
    these yourself; MiniMineMine: technically legan, typically reserved for a 
    type name; number: legal; correct?: not legal, using a special character.

    19. Give five examples of legal names that you shouldn't use because they 
    are likely to cause confusion. - character, boolean, bitAnd, bitOr, andEq.

    20. What are some good rules for choosing names? - not too long but 
    descriptive, use underscores to separate words where possible.

    21. What is type safety and why is it important? - When objects are used 
    only according to the rules for their type. 

    22. Why can conversion from double to int be a bad thing? - Double is bigger
    than int so things may be lost when the conversion is made.

    23. Define a rule to help decide if a conversion from one type to another is
    safe or unsafe. - Use initializers and check the value before assigning.
